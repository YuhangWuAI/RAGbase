                "credit risk capital for the overall wholesale credit portfolio is defined in terms of unexpected credit losses , both from defaults and declines in the portfolio value due to credit deterioration , measured over a one-year period at a confidence level consistent with an 201caa 201d credit rating standard .",
                "unexpected losses are losses in excess of those for which provisions for credit losses are maintained .",
